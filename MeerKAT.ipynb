    "\n",
    "Now the first bit of Montage processing.  Montage uses standard FITS files throughout and FITS files have all the metadata describing the image (for us that mainly means pixel scale, projection type and center, rotation and so on).  To drive the processing we need a \"FITS header\" specification from the user, which we captured above in the header \"template\" file that looks just like a FITS header though with newlines (FITS headers have fixed 80-character card images with no line breaks).  Other ways to get a header template include mHdr, which creates a simple gnomonic projection header using center location, pixel scale and size) and mMakeHdr (which fits a bounding box around a set of images; usually the ones you are about to mosaic).  Or if you know enough you can just create one with an editor.\n",

    "There are many other ways to find images.  The International Virtual Astronomy Alliance (IVOA) has developed a couple of standards for querying metadata (Simple Image Access: SIAP and Table Access Protocol: TAP) which many data providers support.  Our service is focused on a few large uniform datasets (2MASS, DSS, SDSS, WISE).  Other datasets require more care.  For instance, simply downloading all pointed observations of a specific region for a non-survey instrument will include a wide range of integration times (and therefore noise levels) and the mosaicking should involve user-specified weighting of the images (which Montage supports but does not define)."

There is one final twist:  FITS headers allow for distortion parameters.  While these were introduced to deal with instrumental distortions, we can often use them to mimic an arbitrary projection over a small region with a distorted gnomonic projection.  This allows us to use mProjectPP over a wider range of cases and still have flux conservation with increased speed."

Montage provides a general visualization tool (mViewer) which can process a single image or multiple images for full color.  It supports overlays of various sorts.  One of its most useful features is a custom stretch algorithm which is based on gaussian-transformed histogram equalization, optionally with an extra logarithmic transform for really bright excursions.  A large fraction of astronomical images share the general characteristics of having a lot of pixels with something like a gaussian distribution at a low flux level (either background noise of low-level sky structure) coupled with a long histogram tail of very bright point-like sources.  If we apply our algorithm to this, stretching from the -2 or -1 \"sigma\" value of the low-level distribution to the image brightness maximum we usually get a good balance of seeing the low-level structure while still seeing the structure and brightness variations of the bright sources.\n",

We determine from the image metadata (which again includes sky coverage) where there are overlaps.  Then for each pairwise overlap, we compute the image difference.
