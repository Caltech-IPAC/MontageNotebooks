Montage provides a general visualization tool, mViewer, which processes single or multiple images for presentation.    mViewer supports  a custom stretch algorithm based on gaussian-transformed histogram equalization, optionally with an extra logarithmic transforms for images with very bright point-like sources.  Many astronomical images share the general characteristics of having a lot of pixels with  a gaussian-like distribution at a low flux level, either from background noise of low-level sky structure,  coupled with a long histogram tail of very bright point-like sources.  If we apply our algorithm to an image such as this, stretching from the -2 or -1 \"sigma\" value of the low-level distribution to the image brightness maximum we usually find a good balance of seeing the low-level structure while still seeing the structure and brightness variations of the bright sources.\n",

    "In the above image you can see vertical stripes.  Even though the images were accurately flux-calibrated, the background levels in the individual image varied due to changes in the sky background brightness of the sky.  This is a common problem in processing ground-based images; differential photometry is easier than absolute. AS there is no physical model for calculating the sky background,  Montage computes the set of minimum adjustments we can make to the individual image backgrounds to bring them all in-line with each other.  Often, this is just a constant offset, or it may include a slight slope.  Anything more and we are starting to fit the sky structure rather than the background differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is determining the corrections is to analyze the overlap areas between adjacent images.  We determine from the sky coverage image metadata where there are overlaps between images.  Then for each pairwise overlap, we compute the image difference.  There is an explicit assumption here that a such a pair the sources and other real-sky structure match, including flux scales, so the difference should have nothing in it but background differences.  We then fit each difference with a plane (ignoring large excursions just to be safe).\n",
