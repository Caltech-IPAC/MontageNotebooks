    "## mDiffFitExec Example\n",
    "\n",
    "mDiffFitExec is a general utility for generating and fitting a set of image differences. It's most common use is as part of the process of evaluating overlap area in a set of images as part of background rectification. That process consists of taking the output of the overlaps calculation (mOverlaps) and for each overlap pair doing the difference (mDiff), fitting it to determine offset between those two images (mFitplane).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to do this in bulk. We can either generate all the differences first, then fit them all or we can loop over the differences, generating and fitting that difference before moving on to the next. This first approach uses more disks space as all the differences have to be stored in between steps. The second can clean up as it goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously the second approach is preferable unless you want to keep the differences (possibly for quality evaluation).\n",
    "\n",
    "mDiffFitExec is an instantiation of the second approach. It runs mDiff on every pair in the input list and then fits it with a plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point in the processing, we already have a set of \"like\" images (same projection), and have made a list of all the overlaps (normally using mOverlaps).  mDiffFitExec loops over these differences, generating each difference (in a working directory) and fitting a plane to it.\n",
